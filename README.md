# unified-fintech-fraud-ml-system
Comprehensive FinTech fraud analytics system combining classification, anomaly detection, and time-series forecasting for credit card fraud, UPI fraud, loan default prediction, and stock trends.
🔐 Unified FinTech Fraud Detection ML System

Credit Card Fraud | UPI Fraud | Loan Default | Stock Trend Prediction

An end-to-end Machine Learning system for financial fraud analytics and predictive modelling using authentic datasets from RBI, NPCI, SEBI, and Data.gov.in.

📌 Overview

This project integrates four major FinTech ML applications into one unified system:

1️⃣ Credit Card Fraud Detection

Highly imbalanced dataset (<1% fraud)

SMOTE for balancing

XGBoost, Random Forest

Metrics: ROC–AUC, Precision–Recall

2️⃣ Loan Default Prediction

Borrower risk scoring

Feature engineering + EDA

Explainability with SHAP

3️⃣ UPI Fraud Detection

Suspicious transaction pattern detection

Time-series behaviour modelling

Anomaly detection: Isolation Forest, LOF

4️⃣ Stock Trend Forecasting

Forecasting with ARIMA / LSTM

Trend movement classification

Useful for ML roles + time-series exposure

🎯 Why This Project?

✔ Covers classification, anomaly detection, forecasting
✔ Uses official financial datasets (RBI, NPCI, SEBI, OGD India)
✔ Strong placement value for ML / Data Science roles
✔ Demonstrates full ML pipeline + real-world relevance
✔ Perfect for university final year submission + GitHub portfolio
